# IoT-with-Raspberry-Pi
A first effort on an IoT project.

This is a learning project.  I am a great problem solver, but I am in need of having my skillset refreshed.  I decided to 
do some initial work on an Internet of Things (IoT) project  I choose the Raspberry Pi as the "Thing."  The exact nature 
of the project is not defined, as learning will take me in unknown directions -- perfect for using github with new branches for new directions.

My overall concept of the IoT is that a smart phone, iPad, computer, or other device is used to communicate over the internet
to monitor and control an embedded device -- the Thing.

After a bit of research, I found that the Raspberry Pi is often being used as the embedded device.  So I bought a Raspberry Pi.  It was straight forward to set it up on my local network with WiFi.

My next task is to communicate with the RPi over tthe local internet.  I have a linux (Ubuntu 18.04) computer set up for development work, and I will use that system to communicate both ways with the RPi.  My first attemps will be to make a TCP-IP connection and transfer a simple file between the two devices.
